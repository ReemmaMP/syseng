                  <p>This project out the box from VSTS will not compile under VS2015. I’m not sure if this is because we have an old version of the code, but there is a non-fully-implemented interface by default. This is in Droid/Controllers/SaveAndLoadController.cs.
  In order to make this compile the following diff was applied:</p>
                  <img style="width: 100%" src="static/img/hsConsumer.jpg"/>
                  <p>We just commented out the default NotImplementedException, but it does not matter as even if we set a breakpoint on that line it is never hit anyway.

  This change appears to make the code compile, but it immediately crashes upon launch in the Android simulator. We have targeted Android 4.4 and 6.0.1 using the latest build tools and SDKs available from Microsoft and Google, including all the latest Xamarin updates. We have also cleared out various Xamarin caches. Even getting it to build was triggering weird Visual Studio errors about not being able to find the SDK but the cache clearing fixed that.

  The most irritating sticking point here is that the application does not launch; it just crashes on open. There aren’t any error logs as the app doesn’t load far enough for the debugger to attach. We don’t have Hyper-V enabled on our laptop at the moment (as we were using VMware for some other work and only one hypervisor can be active at once).
  At the moment we have no recommendation engine to build atop of (as it won’t deploy / run) and no current app to work off of or analyse (so we still don’t really have much idea of how the UX should be).</p>

            with our clients to secure goals for this project and negotiate what
            features could be implemented. I have also set up and spent some time navigating
            around the different environments that we could have to use. My main
            contribution to the team this week has been through compiling the bi-weekly
            report and communicating effectively with our during the meetings with our
            client, as well as helping brainstorm ideas as to how we could approach the
            project. Having no experience programming in C# prior to this, I will be focusing
            on mastering this language as well as exploring the possibilities of how I
            can contribute more in future</td>

            coordinate having a joint meeting between all three Spot Market teams and the
            clients. This meant that we could all come together and have a better understanding
            of what the larger goal of the project is, in addition to understanding
            what our section is. This way we should be able to avoid project overlap, and
            send Microsoft something useful. I have also made recommendations to the
            team about which development tools we should get, and coordinated with Microsoft
            to get the team set up on VSTS.</td>

            client needs and their requirement, and read the project brief to understand
            the project exactly. And I have done some research in order to prepare for
            the further programming need. Besides, I have tried to pick up some C# and
            worked on some tutorial.</td>

            progress since it resembles Java quite a bit and this is a language I’m familiar with. I have also build a
            basic website to display the project using a Django Framework and plan to develop it further by adding
            more content and styling it with css and bootstrap. So far it contains very little text and have uploaded
            previous I’ve also brainstormed some ideas of what the different functions of a bot could be and depending
            on whether it is acceptable as a ’layer’ mentioned in the initial requirements, I will continue working
            with it or discard the idea. I’ve also complied the bi-weekly report for this week as well as meeting
            minutes.</td>
            <td>Over the last two weeks I have been attempting to build the Xamarin code
            provided to us by Microsoft so that we can get a better idea of what we need to extend and add. I
            have also been emailing Microsoft with some questions such as what data sets we can use. One of my
            other considerations has been how to create a great User Experience. Therefore, we’ve been having
            meetings to discuss details such as battery consumption, making the app useful (and not too intrusive)
            and integration with a shopping model.</td>

            and the progress is well. I learnt how to use windows vm for the Microsoft Visual studio if the
            functionality of Visual studio code is not enough. Besides, I was reading a php and javascript book
            and some related tutorials on php functions, classes, methods for completing a responsive webpage.This

            <td>This week I have been engaged in a range of tasks. Initially, we met with our clients to raise our
            concerns about the abstractness of the given brief. We managed to clear this when they said we had
            the freedom to choose our own method of dealing with the term "layer". As the week processed, I
            invested some time in reading through the documentation that was provided to us from the previous
            team who worked on the task and tried to make sense on what we would be building on top of. I
            have continously been working on the team website and updating it so that it contains all the latest
            documentation and research that we have completed. I also added a team page for the purpose of
            getting to know the team members and individual efforts better. In order to gain a better
            understanding of the app being built, I created a use case analysis to explore each of the use cases
            that we plan to use in our app; this is also something I plan to keep working on and improve upon
            recieving an approved list of requirements. I also helped compile the MoSCoW report based on
            feedback from clients; we hope to get this approved soon</td>
            <td>I have had to principle foci this week. One has been to attempt to compile and get a sense of the
            code from last year. This has involved trying to compile and deploy it to an emulator. Ultimately
            this has not worked so I have now been introduced to Tom from last year’s team. My other focus
            was to ensure the whole team has the resources necessary to proceed. I have now obtained and set
            up (with Windows 10) a Surface 3 device for Hong to work with. I am now working on getting
            some experiments done in Xamarin so that we can make some progress while we wait to find out
            whether last year’s code is useable. If the last code is not useful to us then we have the flexibility to
            create our own app from scratch in Xamarin.</td>
            <td>This week I have continued researching on php functions, classes and methods and I am going to
            help with the team website building. Besides, Chris have help me get a surface 3 this week, so I can
            practice C# in Visual Studio. And I will do some research on delivering apps using Xamarin.</td>
