                  <br>
                  <p>This project out the box from VSTS will not compile under VS2015. I’m not sure if this is because we have an old version of the code, but there is a non-fully-implemented interface by default. This is in Droid/Controllers/SaveAndLoadController.cs.
                    In order to make this compile the following diff was applied:</p>
                  <img style="width: 100%" src="static/img/hsConsumer.jpg"/>
                  <p>We just commented out the default NotImplementedException, but it does not matter as even if we set a breakpoint on that line it is never hit anyway.

                    This change appears to make the code compile, but it immediately crashes upon launch in the Android simulator. We have targeted Android 4.4 and 6.0.1 using the latest build tools and SDKs available from Microsoft and Google, including all the latest Xamarin updates. We have also cleared out various Xamarin caches. Even getting it to build was triggering weird Visual Studio errors about not being able to find the SDK but the cache clearing fixed that.

                    The most irritating sticking point here is that the application does not launch; it just crashes on open. There aren’t any error logs as the app doesn’t load far enough for the debugger to attach. We don’t have Hyper-V enabled on our laptop at the moment (as we were using VMware for some other work and only one hypervisor can be active at once).
                    At the moment we have no recommendation engine to build atop of (as it won’t deploy / run) and no current app to work off of or analyse (so we still don’t really have much idea of how the UX should be).</p>

            more content and styling it with css and bootstrap. So far it contains very little text and have uploaded

            other considerations has been how to create a great User Experience. Therefore, we’ve been having

            concerns about the abstractness of the given brief. We managed to clear this when they said we had
            the freedom to choose our own method of dealing with the term "layer". As the week processed, I
            invested some time in reading through the documentation that was provided to us from the previous
            team who worked on the task and tried to make sense on what we would be building on top of. I
            have continously been working on the team website and updating it so that it contains all the latest
            documentation and research that we have completed. I also added a team page for the purpose of
            getting to know the team members and individual efforts better. In order to gain a better
            understanding of the app being built, I created a use case analysis to explore each of the use cases
            that we plan to use in our app; this is also something I plan to keep working on and improve upon
            recieving an approved list of requirements. I also helped compile the MoSCoW report based on
            feedback from clients; we hope to get this approved soon</td>

            this has not worked so I have now been introduced to Tom from last year’s team. My other focus
            was to ensure the whole team has the resources necessary to proceed. I have now obtained and set
            up (with Windows 10) a Surface 3 device for Hong to work with. I am now working on getting
            some experiments done in Xamarin so that we can make some progress while we wait to find out
            whether last year’s code is useable. If the last code is not useful to us then we have the flexibility to
            create our own app from scratch in Xamarin.</td>
