                <h2>Spot Markets Team 3: Systems Engineering 2016/17 Group 7</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Spot Markets is a collaborative project between Microsoft, Kent County Council and UCL. It promotes business in small local communities, such as in Kent. By applying Machine Learning to social media and purchase data, the project is able to make purchase recommendations to users via a Spot Markets app. Our project is a tourism extension for Spot Markets to allow users to see local Points of Interest, as well as the weather where they are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our app is cross-platform for iOS and Android and is written using C# and Xamarin. The backend is a Django and PostgreSQL web application and API hosted on Microsoft Azure. It pulls weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, and all this data is passed to the Xamarin client apps via JSON.

                        We are two second year undergraduate Computer Science students. Our project is in collaboration with Microsoft and Kent County Council.
                        <br>
                        We are both Computer Science undergraduate students who are working on this project via our Systems Engineering modules at UCL. Over the course of this project, we have gathered user requirements, user stories and prototype UX templates, built a functioning application and tested it. We have gained experience using a modern, cross-platform mobile phone app development framework with a hybrid app approach using Xamarin (as per our client's request). This website is a record of both parts of the project and you will be able to see the research and testing that we completed at the beginning in order to create the final working product.

                        <p>Reemma has been in charge of creating the website and most of the documentation from the initial compilation of the MoSCoW report to creating the use cases for the app as well as researching the testing methods. She has been the secondary technical lead, and created most of the Council Django frontend and initial Xamarin UI design.  She has also been in charge of producing the bi-weekly reports and filmed video content alongside Chris and has ensured that we have met all deadlines set. </p>

                        <p>Chris is the team leader for this project and has acted as the main point of contact between the team and client. He has been the technical lead and wrote most of the Xamarin code, along with the Django backend. He has also been responsible for pushing the code to the cloud so that the API is accessible from anywhere. On top of this, he has also done a chunk of the website and compiled the videos and produced bi-weekly reports. He has also been the one to manage the team and ensure that everyone was pulling in their weight and contributing to the project.</p>
