            <h3>Components Hosted on the Azure VM</h3>
            <h4>PostgreSQL Database</h4>
            <p>
                This database holds all the Points of Interest along with the most recent weather information. Its schema is set up using Django Migrations. It is currently hosted on the Ubuntu Linux Azure VM but it could easily be set up as its own host independently, so long as the environment variables in Django are set up to point to the new host. By default Postgres listens on localhost, TCP Port 5432. As Django is on the same machine, none of the default settings need changing. For security, however, a new password was set up on the PostgreSQL user.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Cron</h4>
            <p>
                Cron is a scheduling utility that is available on most Linux distributions. It has been configured in our case to execute the weather update Django management command every five minutes to ensure that the app data is current.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Python Django Server</h4>
            <p>
                The main server code is written in Python using the Django Rest framework. This listens on 0.0.0.0:8000 (e.g. all IPv4 interfaces) so that it can accept incoming connections from clients on port 8000. As this is a prototype, the Django integrated HTTP server is used. However, in an enterprise or production deployment it would be placed behind Nginx using a tool such as gunicorn to handle multiple instances of the application to distribute load. It exposes to the world a JSON API that allows the client application, written in Xamarin, to extract a serialised version of all the POI data so that it can be processed by the device. The Django server also exposes a web interface that allows Kent County Council to Create, Read, Update &amp; Delete (CRUD) all the locations stored in the database.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Kent County Council: Web Browser</h3>
            <p>
                Employees of the Council can use their web browsers to manipulate the locations stored inside the database using the Django web application. By connecting normally (e.g. not requesting the API directly) in a web browser, the user will be presented with a login screen. Passing this login screen will show the list of locations in the database, along with buttons to edit, delete and add locations. The protocol the web browser uses to talk to Django is standard HTTP. Forms are submitted using POST.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>OpenWeatherMap API</h3>
            <p>
                The OpenWeatherMap API is used both by the Django backend of the application and the Xamarin frontend. The backend makes HTTP GET requests to the API every time the cron job calls the management command. Each of these requests contains the coordinates of each Point of Interest. The API then responds with JSON data corresponding to the weather conditions at each location. The frontend uses standard HTTP GET to download a weather icon corresponding to each type of condition when the user loads the app up. The icon code for each weather type is given via JSON to the frontend when the frontend requests all the other POI data. The frontend then knows which icon for each location to fetch from OpenWeatherMap's server. This saves caching all the icons on our server.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Mobile Device: Xamarin</h3>
            <p>
                The Xamarin code talks to the Django backend by downloading from it a JSON serialised list of Points of Interest. It then parses these into the ListView that is shown to the user when the app is loaded. For each location there is a weather icon code which it can use to fetch a relevant icon from OpenWeatherMap. The map displayed on screen, as explained on the <a href="research.html">Research</a> page, is dependent on the phone's operating system. In any case, this is abstracted away by using Xamarin.Forms.Maps.

                <li>
                    <strong>Model View Controller (MVC)</strong><br> Our Django webapp for Kent County Council is built following
                    the Model View Controller architectural pattern. The Model part corresponds to our permanent store for
                    all the data we collect through our webapp, which is the access to our PostgreSQL database. The View
                    is in charge of the User Interface logic of the application as it generates the HTML code and produces
                    its output which is what the user is able to see. The Controller is the interface between the Model and
                    the View and in our webapp. It is responsible for updating the Model based on user input in the View.
                    [1] The entire MVC Django Application is hosted on a Microsoft Azure Ubuntu Linux instance.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Singleton Pattern</strong><br> Singleton Design Pattern is one of the Gang of Four design patterns.
                    We have used it to ensure only a single instance of each class is created in methods where each class
                    is instantiated. One of the ways in which we were able to implement it in C# is by creating a static
                    variable representing a single instance of each class that is required [2].
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Model View View-Model (MVVM)</strong><br> The MVVM pattern is used in Microsoft products that
                    use XAML to build user interfaces. The model in the Xamarin app is a class that handles connections between
                    the backend Django application which converts the JSON responses into useful objects that represent Points
                    of Interest. Views are partial classes written in XAML which define the frontend screens. The View-Models
                    are partial classes which can access the User Interface objects instantiated by the XAML code and link
                    the contents of them up to the business logic. Some of this is done automatically by using C# bindings,
                    but in many cases the states of the form (e.g. the locations of the pins on the map, which are set up
                    by using data from the Model) must be directly handled by the View-Model. This is also referred to as
                    the "Code-Behind", as it is the code that lays behind the XAML UI.

            <h3>Servers</h3>
            <p>
                Our server is virtual, runs Ubuntu Linux (Server), and is hosted on Microsoft Azure.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Development Machines</h3>
            <p>
                We developed the app on our Windows 10 laptops.
            </p>

            <h3>Build Servers</h3>
            <p>
                Building our code could be done locally using Visual Studio. However, for iOS builds, we had to use a Mac Mini connected to Xamarin via the network. This is because the iOS SDK is only available for macOS.
            </p>

            <h3>Test Devices</h3>
            <p>
                Our code was tested on three Android phones, each of which was running the latest manufacturer-issued firmware:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        OnePlus 3T, running OxygenOS 4.1.3 (Android Nougat 7.1.1). Rooted device.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Nexus 5, running Android 6.0.1. Stock/Unrooted device.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Nexus 5, running Android 6.0.1. Stock/Unrooted device.

        <div class="well">
            <p>
                Our database is defined as a series of Python classes. This is converted into SQL DDL using Django Migrations. We have two types of tables: those we defined ourselves, and those automatically created by Django to support the creation of user accounts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to the complexity of the Django User Model, and that our usage of the user as a foreign key relies on showing this structure, we used Django Extensions and PyVisGraph to generare an Entity-Relationship Diagram from the existing models.

            <p>
                Our development tools were broadly kept within Microsoft's stack, as Microsoft are sponsoring the project; however, where necessary we have deviated.
            </p>

            <h3>Communication</h3>
            <p>
                Team communication typically has happened via WhatsApp Messenger and Telegram for personal messages. This has also allowed us to easily send each other files and sound clips for use in videos. Meetings have mostly taken place on Skype.
            </p>

            <h3>File Storage</h3>
            <p>
                All code for the project is stored on Visual Studio Team Services, and is manipulated via Git (Version Control). All other files are on a shared team OneDrive folder.
            </p>

            <h3>UI Design</h3>
            <p>
                Our prototypes were designed using <a href="http://proto.io">Proto</a>. The final application was created using XAML in Microsoft Visual Studio. The framework for this was Xamarin.Forms.
            </p>

            <h3>Version Control</h3>
            <p>
                The code for the application is stored on Visual Studio Team Services and accessed via Git. New features are added to feature branches until they are complete and stable. Only code that builds and is considered ready for release is merged, via pull requests, into the master branch.
            </p>

            <h3>IDE</h3>
            <p>
                The Django web app was created using Visual Studio Code with the Python extension installed. The main Xamarin code was written in Microsoft Visual Studio with the Xamarin extensions installed. Technologies involved were Xamarin.Forms, C# and XAML.
