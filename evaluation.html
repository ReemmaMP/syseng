                with our clients to secure goals for this project and negotiate what
                features could be implemented. I have also set up and spent some time navigating
                around the different environments that we could have to use. My main
                contribution to the team this week has been through compiling the bi-weekly
                report and communicating effectively with our during the meetings with our
                client, as well as helping brainstorm ideas as to how we could approach the
                project. Having no experience programming in C# prior to this, I will be focusing
                on mastering this language as well as exploring the possibilities of how I
                can contribute more in future</td>
                <td>I have been in contact with Microsoft and helped to
                coordinate having a joint meeting between all three Spot Market teams and the
                clients. This meant that we could all come together and have a better understanding
                of what the larger goal of the project is, in addition to understanding
                what our section is. This way we should be able to avoid project overlap, and
                send Microsoft something useful. I have also made recommendations to the
                team about which development tools we should get, and coordinated with Microsoft
                to get the team set up on VSTS.</td>

                client needs and their requirement, and read the project brief to understand
                the project exactly. And I have done some research in order to prepare for
                the further programming need. Besides, I have tried to pick up some C# and
                worked on some tutorial.</td>

                <td>This week, I have build up more knowledge of C# and am pleased with
                progress since it resembles Java quite a bit and this is a language I’m familiar with. I have also build a
                basic website to display the project using a Django Framework and plan to develop it further by adding
                more content and styling it with css and bootstrap. So far it contains very little text and have uploaded
                previous I’ve also brainstormed some ideas of what the different functions of a bot could be and depending
                on whether it is acceptable as a ’layer’ mentioned in the initial requirements, I will continue working
                with it or discard the idea. I’ve also complied the bi-weekly report for this week as well as meeting
                minutes.</td>
                <td>Over the last two weeks I have been attempting to build the Xamarin code
                provided to us by Microsoft so that we can get a better idea of what we need to extend and add. I
                have also been emailing Microsoft with some questions such as what data sets we can use. One of my
                other considerations has been how to create a great User Experience. Therefore, we’ve been having
                meetings to discuss details such as battery consumption, making the app useful (and not too intrusive)
                and integration with a shopping model.</td>
                <td>This week, I have figured out how to use C-sharp on my Mac and kept on studying Csharp
                and the progress is well. I learnt how to use windows vm for the Microsoft Visual studio if the
                functionality of Visual studio code is not enough. Besides, I was reading a php and javascript book
                and some related tutorials on php functions, classes, methods for completing a responsive webpage.This

                <td>This week I have been engaged in a range of tasks. Initially, we met with our clients to raise our
                concerns about the abstractness of the given brief. We managed to clear this when they said we had
                the freedom to choose our own method of dealing with the term "layer". As the week processed, I
                invested some time in reading through the documentation that was provided to us from the previous
                team who worked on the task and tried to make sense on what we would be building on top of. I
                have continously been working on the team website and updating it so that it contains all the latest
                documentation and research that we have completed. I also added a team page for the purpose of
                getting to know the team members and individual efforts better. In order to gain a better
                understanding of the app being built, I created a use case analysis to explore each of the use cases
                that we plan to use in our app; this is also something I plan to keep working on and improve upon
                recieving an approved list of requirements. I also helped compile the MoSCoW report based on
                feedback from clients; we hope to get this approved soon</td>
                <td>I have had to principle foci this week. One has been to attempt to compile and get a sense of the
                code from last year. This has involved trying to compile and deploy it to an emulator. Ultimately
                this has not worked so I have now been introduced to Tom from last year’s team. My other focus
                was to ensure the whole team has the resources necessary to proceed. I have now obtained and set
                up (with Windows 10) a Surface 3 device for Hong to work with. I am now working on getting
                some experiments done in Xamarin so that we can make some progress while we wait to find out
                whether last year’s code is useable. If the last code is not useful to us then we have the flexibility to
                create our own app from scratch in Xamarin.</td>
                <td>This week I have continued researching on php functions, classes and methods and I am going to
                help with the team website building. Besides, Chris have help me get a surface 3 this week, so I can
                practice C# in Visual Studio. And I will do some research on delivering apps using Xamarin.</td>

                <td>I have taken on a huge range of roles this week. I started by most of the
                the documentation needed to be put on the site, including: compiliing the initial MoSCoW report and
                getting it approved by the clients, team description, use case analysis, taking minutes at client meetings,
                creating a working prototype model of the app we intend to make next term, taking HCI requirements
                into consideration for this project, researching the testing methods etc. My role has been very
                research heavy and I have produced most of the content seen on the website.</td>
                <td>This week I have been doing a mixture of attempting to get some of the code
                supplied by the client compiled and workable. Unfortunately, this has not been successful so I sent
                off some screenshots of issues faced to both the team leader who worked on the project before, and
                Bianca who has been assigned to our project from a technical point of view, but we are still awaiting
                a reply. In the meantime, I have been working with Reemma on updating the website, adding a bunch
                of content (including full descriptions of our MoSCoW report points) and fixing HTML and CSS
                issues.</td>
                <td>This week I have kept on studying and working on getting some experiments done in
                Xamarin. Besides I have done some researches and gave some ideas to use cases which is about
                viewing map. And I have complied this bi-weekly report.</td>
