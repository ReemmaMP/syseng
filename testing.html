                  Along with researching about how to build the app, we looked into Unit testing as well as this is essential to ensuring that our code works in every possible scenario that can be generated. According to this article*, our unit test should be equipped to do the following:
                  <ul >
                    <li> Set the conditions (pre-conditions)</li>
                    <li> Cause the trigger</li>
                    <li> Check for the expected results</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Due to the time limit on this project, we may not be able to explore all the different options for testing. However, a few may be more relevant and good to have implemented. We will be focusing on testing for most commonly occurring issues. For example, we may find that boundary conditions* are a prime source of the bugs found in our application code. Similar to the method shown, we could implement a unit test to catch a StackOverflowException, and if itâ€™s not caught, then the unit test would fail.</p>
                <p>In addition to this, we looked at Visual Studio specific guides on how to set up Unit Tests. As we were still at research stage, we only practised unit testing on smaller, dummy apps we made. To make it work on our Xamarin application, we would need to do the following**:</p>
                <ul >
                  <li> Create a test project</li>
                  <li> Create a test methods within the projects</li>
                  <li> Write the testsSet timeout on each method using a unit test framework. We found out that Visual Studio IntelliSense will be a useful guide in doing this </li>
                  <li> Set timeout on each method</li>
                  <li> Practise running the tests in a test explorer and check for passes and fails and outstanding tests</li>
                </ul>

          <p>The web app is something we have no performed user testing on since it is a side functionality that was built to aid the app we were building. Currently it holds data that has been fed by us, however, Kent County Council should be able to make use of this to add any points of Interest that they wish to.</p>

        <h2>User Acceptance testing</h2>
        <p>We conducted a short user test to get a feel of how well the use cases have been achieved. We tried to perform this on students who had a range of android devices. The results are as follows:</p>
