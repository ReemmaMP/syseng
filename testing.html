                    <p>It appears as though there is some sort of Flask project in this repository. Opening the Visual Studio solution doesn’t appear to load all the files (is the project broken?)</p>
                    <p>Update on 12th December: we have since had a meeting with Bianca and she updated the code in the respository to a newer version. She informed us that the sln file can be used to set up the environment and that we should call the rest of the Python code directly. However, this has not worked yet, and both parties are currently working to try to get the right requirements installed so that the code will run.</p>

                    <p>Update on 12th December: we have been informed by Bianca that we must deploy the database first, and that we may not even need this part of the code to deploy to build our section of the app. Even though the code seems broken, we may be able to ignore it and move on with the rest of the project.</p>

                      <p>This project out the box from VSTS will not compile under VS2015. I’m not sure if this is because we have an old version of the code, but there is a non-fully-implemented interface by default. This is in Droid/Controllers/SaveAndLoadController.cs.
                        In order to make this compile the following diff was applied:</p>
                      <img style="width: 100%"  src="original/static/img/hsConsumer.jpg"/>
                      <p>We just commented out the default NotImplementedException, but it does not matter as even if we set a breakpoint on that line it is never hit anyway.

                        This change appears to make the code compile, but it immediately crashes upon launch in the Android simulator. We have targeted Android 4.4 and 6.0.1 using the latest build tools and SDKs available from Microsoft and Google, including all the latest Xamarin updates. We have also cleared out various Xamarin caches. Even getting it to build was triggering weird Visual Studio errors about not being able to find the SDK but the cache clearing fixed that.

                        The most irritating sticking point here is that the application does not launch; it just crashes on open. There aren’t any error logs as the app doesn’t load far enough for the debugger to attach. We don’t have Hyper-V enabled on our laptop at the moment (as we were using VMware for some other work and only one hypervisor can be active at once).
                        At the moment we have no recommendation engine to build atop of (as it won’t deploy / run) and no current app to work off of or analyse (so we still don’t really have much idea of how the UX should be).</p>
                        <p>
                          Update on 12th December: we have been told that the Android code should never have been included in the repository we were given, and instead we should just build a fresh app from scratch. Also, if we set up Xamarin on a Mac, we should be able to build the iOS app. We are yet to try this as we are all using Windows in the group.
