              We are one of three teams working on the <em>Spot Markets</em> project. The overall project aims to revolutionise the high street by providing shoppers with location-based and time-relevant notifications. An example scenario would be if, once the software has looked into the shopper's purchase history and seen that they purchased a pair of red shoes last week, the application would suggest to the user that they purchase a corresponding red handbag when they pass a shop selling one with a 10% discount.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our extension to this project is a tourism layer that uses the data harvested for the shopping notifications to recommend relevant tourist attractions that a user may find interesting. The object is to make these notifications as relevant as possible at a time that makes most sense.
            </p>
            <p>
              The original version of this project was created by some MSc students last year, and we are attempting to continue this project with the aforementioned tourism layer.

              We are three second year undergraduate Computer Science students. Our project is in collaboration with Microsoft and Kent County Council.

            <p style="text-align: left;">
              We are all computer science undergraduates who are working on this project as part of one of our Systems Engineering module. Over the course of this project, we have gathered user requirements, user stories, app framework, prototype UX templates, testing etc. We have gained experience using a modern, cross-platform mobile phone app development framework with a “hybrid app” approach using Xamarin (as per our client's request). This is the first part of the project and you will be able to see the research and testing that we completed at the beginning in order to create the final working product.
